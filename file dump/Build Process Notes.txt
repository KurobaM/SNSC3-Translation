### Build ###

Run build.bat. This should import:
- Scripts (via scriptinserter/swordcraft3c)
- ASM patches (via armips swordcraft3.asm)
- Graphics (via armips swordcraft3.asm)

### Graphics ###

To export from rom:
- Make sure the original rom is in the root directory as swordcraft3.gba.
- In gfxscripts/ run extract_all.cmd. This should populate gfxscript/raw/ with bmp, map.bin, and tile.bin files.
- The firewood files appear to be compressed differently. In gfxscript/uncomp/ you can find those files already.
- The bmp generation process uses extract_bmp.cmd. In the event that you have different files you need to pull from, you can edit that script to point to the new path. For instance, with the firewood files, I edited the snsc3gfx command to point to uncomp/ instead of raw/.

To import to rom (from bmp):
- Make sure the original rom is in the root directory as swordcraft3.gba.
- Put your bmps in gfxscript/eng.
- In gfxscripts/ run compile_all.cmd. You will want to un-comment the lines for things you actually want to compile.
- Firewood is extra special so we have to handle it differently. Run compile_firewood.cmd. 
- Your output files should be in the gfxscripts/final/ folder. You will want to copy them into the (root)/asm/ folder. There should already be files there that you're replacing, so it should be clear where they go. Again, Firewood is V.E's special boy, so it goes in the firewood/ folder. Some other things have their own folders here as well.
